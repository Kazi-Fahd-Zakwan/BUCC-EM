			<h1 class="one_h1">Pre-Event Activities</h1>

			<p class="one_p">There are certain tasks which Event Management Department needs to complete before an event</p>

			<ul class="one_ul">
				
				<li>
					<b>Venue/Room Booking: </b> Room/venue booking of the particular event must be done by EM. If the venue is at UB4, UB6, UB7 or UB8, then EM needs to mail the DCO of CSE department in order to book the room. In addition, for venues which are situated at UB1, UB2, UB3 or UB5, EM needs to collect the room booking form from Office of Student Life (OSL), afterwards fill it up with necessary information about the event and submit it at the registers office. In both cases, EM needs to confirm the venue after requesting for it. 
				</li><br>
				
				<li>
					<b>Guest ID: </b> EM needs to collect Guest ID from the guards table at ground floor of the university building where the event is going to be held. For collecting it, they must show the proposal letter of that event which must be signed by OSL/CSE department and Register. It is needless to mention that, without the guest ID, guests can't enter the university building at any cost.
				</li><br>
				
				<li>
					<b>Necessary Requirements: </b> EM needs to manage all the necessary requirements of an event. Requirements include food, projector, marker, X-banner, crest, certificate etc. In case any item needs to be brought from the shop, remember to collect the receipt. To know about the requirements of an event, EM must go through the proposal letter thoroughly because requirements must be included in the proposal letter. It is the responsibility of EM to bring the required things before the event. 
				</li><br>

				<li>
					<b>Photographers: </b> The photographer selection process of an event is supervised by EM. Generally, one or two photographers are selected for an particular event who covers the event. In rare cases where the photographer doesn't have a DSLR camera, EM needs to manage the camera from other photographers who has DSLR camera.
				</li><br>

				<li>
					<b>EM Representatives: </b> Before an event, EM needs to select volunteers from EM department who are going to represent the department during the event. Typically, two to four volunteers are selected for an particular event who would represent EM department at the event. The volunteers have huge responsibilities during the event which will be discussed in the on-event activities.

				</li><br>

				<li>
